AutoAudio Installation/User Manual

1. To use this program, you must first download the source code
   from the Git repository. You can do this through your browser at the URL: 
   <https://github.com/EricaNguyen/AutoAudio>.

2. You will also need Python, version 3: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>.
   Download any version of Python 3 and run the installer.
-- When installing: on the first page, ensure that you check the box at the bottom
   that reads: “Add Python 3.#.# to PATH”
-- You will also need to ensure that the pip tool is installed. This should be done
   by default when you click “Install Now”, but you can check this manually by
   clicking “Customize Installation” and making sure the box named “pip” is checked.

3. You may also need to install additional build tools to run the program.
-- For Windows, go to the link <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/> and scroll down.
   You do NOT need to install the full Visual Studio package. Expand the tab labelled
   “Tools for Visual Studio 2019” and download the “Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019”.
   Once downloaded, run the executable to install the tools.

4. Install Python libraries needed to run the program: numpy, aubio, and pyaudio.
-- In Windows, open a Command Prompt and install the given libraries using pip and pipwin.
   This can be done by simply entering the commands:
   <python -m pip install --user pipwin>
   <python -m pipwin install --user pyaudio numpy>
   <python -m pip install --user aubio>
-- Wheels for each library can be installed manually, in case errors occur:
   https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

5. Install LilyPond from <http://lilypond.org/>.
-- The LilyPond website gives documentation on installation, as well as
   how to add the program to PATH, as this must be done manually

6. For non-Linux/Unix systems, you will need a Bash emulator.
   This can be used through git, which can be downloaded from: <https://git-scm.com/downloads>

7. Once everything has been properly installed, run the executable located in:
   <DIR\AutoAudio-master\src\AutoAudio.exe>
