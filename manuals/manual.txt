Welcome to AutoAudio!

This program uses the LilyPond music engraving program to help YOU write your own sheet music!
No need to understand complex music theory!
Just hit “Start Recording” and start singing, playing your favorite instrument, or just making sounds.
When you’re done expressing yourself, press “Stop Recording” and your song will be written for you.
Just run the resultant “NoteSheet.ly” file with LilyPond and open the PDF file written by the program to see it.
Now anyone can be a music composer! Hit “Start” and have fun!
